* Trip Types
  I think I'm pretty set on doing a Unit loop. Would like to see some glaciers!
* Terrian Types
** River Crossings
   There are no bridges accross rivers. Water temperature is cold (36F) so a
   cold immersion could potentially cause hypothermia.
   Advice:
   1. Keep hiking boots on to protect your feet.
   2. Use a trekking pole (or a stick) to gauge water depth.
* Potential Units
  Some quick summaries of some interesting-sounding units that don't require
  expert backpacking skills.
** Beginner Units
*** Unit 1 - Triple Lakes
    One of the few areas in the park with a trail. Good option for large groups.
*** Unit 9 - East Branch Toklat River
    Wide-open gravel bar, surrounded by high, rugged peaks. Known for classic
    mountain scenery and quick access to large expanses of alpine tundra. Very
    popular so it is diffucult to get a permit.
*** Unit 10 - West Branch Upper Toklat River
    Similar to unit 9, but on a slightly larger scale.
*** Unit 11 - Stony Dome
    Easy to get away from the road. Smallest backcountry unit in the park so
    suited for an overnight trip or a hike in connection with another unit.
*** Unit 12 - Sunrise and Sunset Glaciers
    Surrounded by tundra benches and high peaks. Very popular unit so expect
    to have difficult getting a permit. Don't expect as much solitude.
*** Unit 13 - Mount Eielson
